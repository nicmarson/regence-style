{"name":"Regence-style","tagline":"","body":"regence-style\r\n=============\r\n<a href=\"http://getbootstrap.com\">\r\n  <img src=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/img/bootstrap-docs-readme.png\" width=\"100px\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\nThe Regence and associated portal sites are based on the Twitter Bootstrap framework. Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development, created and maintained by [Mark Otto](http://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thornton](http://twitter.com/fat).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\n* Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/nicmarson/regence-style.git`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Compiling CSS and JavaScript\r\n\r\nBootstrap includes a [makefile](Makefile) with convenient methods for working with the framework. Before getting started, be sure to install [the necessary local dependencies](package.json):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen completed, you'll be able to run the various make commands provided:\r\n\r\n#### build - `make`\r\nRuns the recess compiler to rebuild the `/less` files and compiles the docs. Requires recess and uglify-js.\r\n\r\n#### test - `make test`\r\nRuns jshint and qunit tests headlessly in [phantomjs](http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/) (used for ci). Depends on having phantomjs installed.\r\n\r\n#### watch - `make watch`\r\nThis is a convenience method for watching just Less files and automatically building them whenever you save. Requires the Watchr gem.\r\n\r\nShould you encounter problems with installing dependencies or running the makefile commands, be sure to first uninstall any previous versions (global and local) you may have installed, and then rerun `npm install`.\r\n\r\nIf you're compiling files on a Mac, then I suggest using [Codekit]()\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nJavaScript must include relevant unit tests. All HTML and CSS should conform to the [Code Guide](http://github.com/saintsalo/code-guide), maintained by [Salo](http://github.com/saintsalo).\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Author\r\n\r\n**Nicholas Marson**\r\n\r\n+ [http://twitter.com/nicmarson](http://twitter.com/nicmarson)\r\n+ [http://github.com/nicmarson](http://github.com/nicmarson)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright and license\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013 Cambia\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\nyou may not use this work except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License in the LICENSE file, or at:\r\n\r\n  [http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\nlimitations under the License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
